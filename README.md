We have the first super class which is called Product. It has 3 subclasses ; Electronic Product, Clothing Product, Book Product. Used private methods in order to limit access to the constructors (Product Id, Name,Price). Used setters and getters to set and return values + used Math.abs function to take absolute integer or float values.

ElectronicProduct CLASS: This class inherits all the attributes and method from Product class. It defines 2 attributes [brand & warrantyPeriod] It has one constructor that taked 5 arguments and it calls the superclass constructor to initialize the inherited attributes. Setter Methods to set each attribute & Getter Methods to return the value of each attribute , then it assigns [brand , warrantyPeriod] to their own attributes

ClothingBrand CLASS: This class inherits all the attributes and method from Product class. It has one constructor that taked 5 arguments and it calls the superclass constructor to initialize the inherited attributes. Setter Methods to set each attribute & Getter Methods to return the value of each attribute , then it assigns [size , fabric] to their own attributes.

BookProduct CLASS: This class inherits all the attributes and method from Product class. It has one constructor that taked 5 arguments and it calls the superclass constructor to initialize the inherited attributes. Setter Methods to set each attribute & Getter Methods to return the value of each attribute , then it assigns [authour , publisher] to their own attributes.

CUSTOMER CLASS: The class provides 3 attributes [customerId , name , address]. The class has one constructor:Customer(int customerId, String name, String address): This constructor takes three arguments to initialize the customer object. It ensures a positive customerId by using Math.abs().

Class Cart is a class used for preparing the cart where the customer will add his/her order in. we use the customer Id, number of products & array to count the order starting with element 0. we create a method to add product and we add to the index of array 1. another method to remove product adding if-condition if the index if more than 0&&less than the no of products ,then it will go inside a for loop to decrease the index by one. the last method to calculate price where we add the total price of products then use the getters to get and return final price.

Then the last class order, used setters and getters to take all the required info from the customer which are (Cst Id,Order Id,Products,TotalPrice) Print statements to give the order summary ,display the order id,customer id,products, and the total price
MAIN CLASS: There are 3 product categories [ElectronicProduct , ClothingBrand , BookProduct] each of them has its attributes and it creates instances of these products representing smartphone,T-shirt,and Book. This code uses a Scanner to get input from the user. It gets the user to enter his/her customer ID,name,address then it asks the user about how many products he wants and creats Cart object based on the number of products. The code uses a loop to iterate for the number of products the user wants to add. Inside the loop, it presents a menu with the three product options (smartphone, T-shirt, book) and asks the user to choose. Based on the user's choice, it adds the corresponding product object (smartphone, T-shirt, or book) to the user's cart using the addProduct method of the Cart class. If the user enters an invalid choice, it displays an error message and skips adding a product for that iteration. After adding products, the code calculates the total price of the cart using the calculatePrice method of the Cart class. It displays the total price and asks the user whether they want to place the order (1 - Yes, 2 - No). If the user chooses to place the order (1), the code likely calls a placeOrder method in the Cart class, which might handle tasks like order confirmation or interacting with a payment system.If the user cancels (2), the code displays an "Order canceled" message
